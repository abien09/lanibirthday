            <h1 class="aboutme">Hi, i'm Lani. A girl who is busy in college semester 2. For age, i don't need to tell you times yes, you can estimate it yourself. Actually my full name is Azzahra Amelani, Lani is just a nickname for the people around me. I was born in the capital city, but... grew up in South Tangerang. To be precise, i was just born in Jakarta, hahaha. My family? I live with my parents and my two younger siblings, yep I'm the first of three children. They're still small, one is in junior high school and the other is in elementary school. 

                Hmm what else is it? Oh yeah, my mbti is ESFP-A, because I'm a person who tends to be extroverted and likes to hang out with a lot of people, so maybe the people closest to me are used to my random behavior. Zodiac? i'm a member of cancer, which means i was born in the month of july, to be precise on july 3, 2005. For height, i belong to the group of short people, because my height is only 153 cm, really short right? But that's okay, we have to stay grateful for what it is.
                
                Hobbies, my hobbies are many, and very random, maybe like watching netflix, do some make up, making transition content, eating sweet, dancing, and many more, I don't think it will be finished if I mention them all, hahaha. Oh yeah, I tend to be an open person if I find something that doesn't match my expectations, so I prefer to directly protest if there are things that don't match my wishes, and maybe there are some things that I don't like, such as lessons that focus on theory, petai, toxic or two-faced people, failing exams, overthinking, and crowded places. But on the other hand, I also have things that make me happy. Like dancing, friends, feeling comfy, ofc my boyfriend, traveling, sweet food and drinks, make-up, shopping, and of course I love moneyðŸ˜Š. 
                
                Well, now I want to tell you some of my favorite things, starting from movies, I like movies with romance, horror, slice of life, and drama genres, you guessed it I like drakor. Then for music I like pop, hip hop, k-pop, yep I'm one of the fangirls who is quite active until now. I really really like kai exo and kim mingyu, and for k-dramas, I really really like Ji Chang-wook, also Ahn Hyeo-seop. They're like angels in this world, I swear. I'm also a lover of c-dramas and the actors, namely Chen Zheyuan, in essence I'm very crazy about them. Already, enough about fangirling, let's move on to something else. 
                
                I have a lot of wishlist, like I really want to go to London from childhood, but it hasn't been accomplished yet, then I also really want to have a 3 billion house, aamiin, say aamiin everything, aamiin allahumma aamiin. What else? I'm confused, let's ask abien first ...</h1>
